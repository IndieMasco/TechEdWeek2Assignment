# Reflection

For Week 2's assignment, we were asked to build an accessible image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We had to make sure that the gallery was functional, inclusive, and displayed correctly across various platforms while also meeting the set goals.

# Requirements I think I've achieved

- 🎯 Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px). ✅
- 🎯 Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned). ✅
- 🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility. ✅
- 🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions. ✅

# Stretch Requirements

- 🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
- 🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
- 🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.

# Extra things i have added

- when viewing on a mobile ive added a prompt to tell people "Please rotate your device to landscape mode for the best viewing experience.".

# Errors or Bugs I Encountered

- At first, when I tried running my JS code bit by bit to see if it was working, I kept getting errors with the createLargeImagesHandler function. The error kept saying it was undefined. It took me a while to figure it out with Google and talking with Will, but the error turned out to be that I was missing an "i" within the code.
