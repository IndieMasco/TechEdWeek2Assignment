# Requirements I think I've achieved

- 🎯 Implement responsive design methods to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px). ✅
- 🎯 Implement at least one meaningful media query so that there is a noticeable change between mobile and desktop view (an example is to change where the ‘thumbnail bar’ is positioned). ✅
- 🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility. ✅
- 🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions. ✅

# Stretch Requirements

- 🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
- 🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
- 🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.
